<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The extraction plan is a view of the design of your extractor
as you build it.  </p>
<p class="p">With the extraction plan, you identify, organize, and navigate
the elements that you want to extract.  You create and develop the
AQL that is associated with the plan level (Basic Features, Candidate
Generation, Filter and Consolidate, Final).   The Extraction Plan
contains the project name and the root label after you label the code
snippet.  The root label contains an example, which is the text that
you highlighted within the editor pane.</p>
<p class="p">From the Extraction Plan, you can see the dependencies of an AQL
statement on the labels and examples. </p>
<p class="p">In the extraction plan, you have a choice of seeing all of the
AQL views and their hierarchies and structures or only the AQL views.
You can also toggle between hiding empty nodes and a full view.</p>
