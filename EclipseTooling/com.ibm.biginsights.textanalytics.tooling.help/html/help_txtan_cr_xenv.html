					After you create the project, a project structure is created for

					folder.

					If you are using data that is captured from tweet feeds or other
					sources that might produce a large volume of data, consider
					starting the extraction development process by using a subset of
					your data instead of downloading all of the data from the cluster.

						Console</span>, you can select the data sampling or the data subset
					applications to reduce the amount of data to work with.
