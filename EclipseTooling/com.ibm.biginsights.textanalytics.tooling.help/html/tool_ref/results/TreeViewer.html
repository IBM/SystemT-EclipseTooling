			<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Color highlighting</h2>
			<p class="p">
				Each attribute that is displayed in the <span
					class="keyword wintitle">Result Tree View</span> is highlighted in
				a different color on the tree. By selecting an element of the tree,
				you highlight the attribute values in the input document with the
				same color. You can then visualize multiple selected results in the
				input document.
			</p>
			<p class="p">By selecting a parent element of the tree view, you
				select all of its children. By clearing an element, you remove its
				highlighting as well as the highlighting of its child elements from
				the document.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overlapping attributes</h2>
			<p class="p">
				Overlapping values are highlighted with the color that corresponds
				to the largest value in the lexicographic order of node names in the
				<span class="keyword wintitle">Result Tree View</span>. For example,
				assume that a view, <span class="keyword parmname parmname">MyView</span>,
				contains two attributes, <span class="keyword parmname parmname">X</span>
				and <span class="keyword parmname parmname">Y</span>. If both
				elements are selected in the tree, the color that is used for
				highlighting a <span class="keyword parmname parmname">MyView.X
				</span> value that overlaps with a <span class="keyword parmname parmname">MyView.Y</span>
				value is the color that is used for <span
					class="keyword parmname parmname">MyView.Y</span>, since <span
					class="keyword parmname parmname">MyView.Y</span> appears after <span
					class="keyword parmname parmname">MyView.X</span> in the
				lexicographic order.

					<samp class="ph codeph">detag</samp>
					statement. In this case, the <span class="keyword wintitle">Result
