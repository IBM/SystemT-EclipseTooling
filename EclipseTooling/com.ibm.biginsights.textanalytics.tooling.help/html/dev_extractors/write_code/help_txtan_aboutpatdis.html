	<div class="body conbody">
		<p class="shortdesc">
			Given an input corpus and an initial extractor, the Pattern
			discovery, a feature included in the <span class="keyword">InfoSphere®
				BigInsights™</span> Eclipse tooling, groups input contexts with similar
			semantics and distills patterns from them. You can then decide which
			of the patterns needs to be implemented in the extractor.
		</p>
		<p class="p">By using AQL, you can write rules to extract
			structured information from unstructured text. However, to identify
			the rules to accurately extract the information, you must manually
			sift through a potentially large data collection, a time consuming
			and error-prone process.</p>
		<div class="section">
			<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example of usage</h2>
			<div class="p">
				Consider the following simple <span class="keyword apiname">phone</span>
				extractor:
				<pre class="pre codeblock">
					<code>create view PhoneCandidate as
extract
 	regexes /\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/
	    on D.text as num
from Document D;   

output view PhoneCandidate;  </code>
				</pre>
			</div>
			<p class="p">
				This rule captures many valid telephone numbers that have the form
				<var class="keyword varname">xxx-xxx-xxxx</var>
				. It also captures invalid phone numbers, such as fax numbers, which
				are specified using the same format. However, it does not capture
				many other phone numbers, such as international numbers or extension
				numbers.
			</p>
			<div class="p">
				You can use Pattern discovery to find patterns in the vicinity of a
				telephone number candidate. Based on these patterns, you can then
				write additional rules to refine the <span class="keyword apiname">phone</span>
				extractor. You can see in the following example that the left
				context can usually reveal whether the candidate is valid or
				invalid:
				<dl class="dl">
					<dt class="dt dlterm">Valid candidate (telephone number)</dt>
					<dd class="dd">
						<pre class="pre codeblock">
							<code>'Call me at 555-123-4567'</code>
						</pre>
					</dd>
					<dt class="dt dlterm">Invalid candidate (fax number, not a
						telephone number)</dt>
					<dd class="dd">
						<pre class="pre codeblock">
							<code>'Fax#: 555-123-4567'</code>
						</pre>
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</div>
			<div class="p">
				If you used Pattern discovery on these contexts, it automatically
				finds such negative and positive clues. The following examples are
				patterns that the algorithm might discover, along with suggestions
				for using these patterns to develop additional rules to improve the
				precision and recall of the <span class="keyword apiname">phone</span>
				extractor. In the example coding, the Pattern Discovery algorithm is
				invoked on the context of length 4 tokens immediately preceding a
				phone annotation.
				<dl class="dl">
					<dt class="dt dlterm">
						Example 1:
						<var class="keyword varname">'fax'</var>
					</dt>
					<dd class="dd">
						<div class="p">
							This pattern indicates that the keyword
							<var class="keyword varname">fax</var>
							commonly precedes a telephone number candidate. It is a negative
							clue that can be used to improve the precision of the <span
								class="keyword apiname">phone</span> extractor by filtering out
							invalid candidates, such as in the following example:
							<pre class="pre codeblock">
								<code> create dictionary FaxClueDict as (
		'fax'
	);
	
	create view PhoneSimple as
	extract
 	regexes /\+?\(\d{3}\) ?\d{3}-\d{4}/ and /\+?\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/ 
	    on D.text as num
	from Document D
having Not(ContainsDict('FaxClueDict', LeftContextTok(num, 4)));</code>
							</pre>
						</div>
					</dd>
					<dt class="dt dlterm">
						Example 2:
						<var class="keyword varname">'phone'</var>
						or
						<var class="keyword varname">'call;at'</var>
					</dt>
					<dd class="dd">
						<p class="p">
							these patterns indicate that the keyword
							<var class="keyword varname">phone</var>
							and the keywords
							<var class="keyword varname">call</var>
							and
							<var class="keyword varname">at</var>
							(in this order) commonly occur in the vicinity of a telephone
							number candidate.
						</p>
						<div class="p">
							They are positive clues that improve the precision of the <span
								class="keyword apiname">PhoneSimple</span> rule by returning
							only those matches for the regular expression that are preceded
							within a number of tokens by one of these clues:
							<pre class="pre codeblock">
								<code> create dictionary PhoneClueDict as (
		'phone', 'call', 'at'
	);
	
	create view PhoneSimpleStrong as
	select P.*
	from PhoneSimple P
where ContainsDict('PhoneClueDict', LeftContextTok(num, 4));</code>
							</pre>
						</div>
					</dd>
					<dd class="dd">
						<div class="p">
							You can also use these positive clues to improve the recall of
							the <span class="keyword apiname">Phone</span> extractor by
							discovering other telephone number patterns not yet captured by
							the <span class="keyword apiname">PhoneSimple</span> rule. For
							example, in the following AQL snippet, the view
							<var class="keyword varname">PhoneClueRightContext</var>
							selects the context immediately succeeding a telephone number
							clue identified by the Pattern Discovery algorithm such as
							<var class="keyword varname">phone</var>
							,
							<var class="keyword varname">call</var>
							, or
							<var class="keyword varname">at</var>
							that contains at least 3 consecutive digits but not a known
							telephone number candidate.
							<pre class="pre codeblock">
								<code> create view PhoneClue as 
	extract dictionary 'PhoneClueDict' on D.text as clue
	from Document D; 

	-- Right context of a phone clue containing digits
	create view PhoneClueContextAll as
	select P.clue as clue, RightContextTok(P.clue, 15) as rightCtx
	from PhoneClue P
	where ContainsRegex(/\d{3}/, RightContextTok(P.clue, 15)); 
	
	-- Right context of a phone clue with a known phone candidate
	create view PhoneClueContextKnownPhone as
	select P.*
	from PhoneClueContextAll P, PhoneSimple Ph
	where Contains(P.rightCtx, Ph.num);
	
	-- Right context of a phone clue without an already identified phone candidate
	create view PhoneClueRightContext as
	(select * from PhoneClueContextAll)
	minus
	(select * from PhoneClueContextKnownPhone);
	
output view PhoneClueRightContext;</code>
							</pre>
						</div>
						<div class="p">
							Depending on the data collection, the view
							<var class="keyword varname">PhoneClueRightContext</var>
							selects contexts that contain valid telephone numbers in other
							formats not yet captured by the <span class="keyword apiname">PhoneSimple</span>
							view, such as
							<var class="keyword varname">[Lorraine Becker at] x31680</var>
							or
							<var class="keyword varname">[Lorraine's phone] is x-1680</var>
							. You can then select example telephone numbers and use them as
							input to the Regular Expression Generator component to generate
							one or more regular expressions and capture these new telephone
							number formats in the <span class="keyword apiname">PhoneSimple</span>
							view:
							<pre class="pre codeblock">
								<code>	create view PhoneSimple as
	extract
 	regexes /\+?\(\d{3}\) ?\d{3}-\d{4}/ and /\+?\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/ and /x-?\d{4,5}/
	    on D.text as num
	from Document D;</code>
							</pre>
						</div>
					</dd>
					<dt class="dt dlterm">
						Example 3:
						<var class="keyword varname">'phone;&lt;PhoneSimple.num&gt;'</var>
					</dt>
					<dd class="dd">
						<p class="p">
							This pattern indicates that a
							<var class="keyword varname">&lt;PhoneSimple.num&gt;</var>
							match and the keyword
							<dfn class="term">phone</dfn>
							commonly occur in the vicinity of a telephone number candidate.
						</p>
						<p class="p">
							This pattern is distilled from contexts such as
							<samp class="ph codeph">'Reach me at 555-123-4567 or '</samp>
							where the occurrence of

					<dt class="dt dlterm">Known Entity Summarization</dt>
					<dd class="dd">
						<p class="p">When you develop an extractor, you might have
							access to a list of known instances of an entity. You can use
							Pattern Discovery to identify common patterns that help you write
							more general rules to capture matches of the entity. The
							following actions illustrate this scenario:</p>
						<p class="p">
							You are developing an organization extractor, and you have access
							to a list of Fortune 1000 organizations. By using Pattern
							Discovery, you can identify a list of common organization
							suffixes from the Fortune 1000 organization list, such as
							<var class="keyword varname">'Co.'</var>
							and
							<var class="keyword varname">'Corporation'</var>
							. Create a dictionary of these strong organization suffixes. Use
							that dictionary in a rule to identify candidate organizations as
							one or more capitalized tokens followed by a match for the suffix
							in the dictionary.
						</p>
					</dd>
					<dt class="dt dlterm">Relationship extractor</dt>
					<dd class="dd">
						<p class="p">When you write an extractor to identify
							relationships between entities, you can use Pattern Discovery to
							identify strong clues that are indicative of relationships in the
							input data set. The following actions illustrate this scenario:</p>
						<p class="p">
							Assume that you are developing an extractor to extract
							relationships between Person and Organization mentions. By using
							Pattern Discovery on the context between two mentions of these
							entities, you can discover common patterns, such as
							<samp class="ph codeph">'works for'</samp>
							, or
							<samp class="ph codeph">'is employed by'</samp>
							.
