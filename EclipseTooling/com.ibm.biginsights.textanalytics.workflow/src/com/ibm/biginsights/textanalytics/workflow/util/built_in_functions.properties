PREDICATE_FUNCTIONS = And | Contains | ContainsDict | ContainsRegex | ContainsRegex | Equals | Follows | FollowsTok | GreaterThan | MatchesDict | MatchesRegex | Not | NotNull | Or | Overlaps

Not = The Not function takes a single Boolean argument and returns its complement.
NotNull = The NotNull function takes a single argument of any type. As its name suggests, NotNull returns TRUE if the value of the argument is not NULL.
Or = The Or function takes a variable number of Boolean arguments and returns TRUE if any of them evaluates to TRUE. This function will eventually be replaced by SQL-style infix OR syntax.
Overlaps = The Overlaps scalar function takes two span arguments:\nOverlaps(<span1>, <span2>)\nThe function returns TRUE if the two input spans overlap in the document text.
