			In some cases, the Text Analytics optimizer cannot choose the most
			efficient execution plan. When that is the case, you can use the AQL
			Profiler to identify which portion of the plan can be improved
			through manual tuning. The AQL Profiler is included in the <span
				class="keyword">InfoSphere® BigInsights™</span> Eclipse Tooling.
		</p>
		<p class="p">
			The Profiler generates reports that can help you troubleshoot
			performance problems in the AQL code. For more information, see <a
				class="xref"
				href="http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSPT3X_3.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.infosphere.biginsights.text.doc/doc/ana_txtan_extract-perform.html"
				target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">
				Improving extractor performance</a> for help in determining if your
			extractor requires performance tuning, and how to solve common
			performance problems.
		</p>
		<p class="p">The Profiler also calculates the throughput of the
			extractor (in KB/seconds) by dividing the size of the data that was
			processed by the total duration of the Profiler execution. The higher
			the value, the better: more data is processed per second, and the
			extractor is faster. As you tune the AQL hot spots identified by the
			Profiler, verify that the throughput value increases the next time
			you rerun the Profiler. You may need to repeat the process until you
			are satisfied with the extractor performance.</p>
		<p class="p">The Profiler generates the following reports that can
			help you troubleshoot performance problems in the AQL code.</p>
		<div class="section">
			<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Top 25 Views by Execution Time
				report</h2>
			<p class="p">Helps you understand which of the views took the
				longest time to run. For a moderately complex extractor, a view that
				takes more than 5% of the execution time is a potential hot spot.
				(In general, you can ignore the time taken by 'Tokenization and POS
				Tagging', which is expected to take a longer time in general.)</p>
			<div class="p">
				These views are good candidates for manual tuning in order to
				improve their performance.
				<div class="note remember">
					<span class="remembertitle">Remember:</span> Not all views are
					equal: some will take more that 5%, some will take less. Use good
					judgment when you evaluate the amount of resource that a view
					takes.
				</div>
				<div class="note tip">
					<span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> Focus on optimizing the most
					expensive views.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Top 25 documents by running time
				report</h2>
			<div class="p">
				Displays the average time to annotate each document in the data
				collection. This summary can provide you with some clues to isolate
				documents that take longer to annotate and analyze deeper why a
				particular type of data content takes longer time duration.
				<div class="note remember">
					<span class="remembertitle">Remember:</span> Some documents take
					longer to process than others because they are larger, the density
					of results is larger, or the document exhibits some characteristic
					that makes the extractor slower.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Top 25 documents over 1KB by
				normalized running time report</h2>
			<p class="p">Displays the normalized running time per MB of text
				for documents larger than 1 KB. A higher number means the extractor
				is slower on that document. This report also displays the extractor
				throughput, the higher the throughput, the faster the extractor.</p>
