Before you begin, create a list of examples that depict the concept behind the regular expression that you want to generate. Collect examples into a simple text file (*.txt), one per line.

refine the expression by examining and modifying the subexpressions

generated regular expression adds an escape character to the forward
slash character (//). This adjustment facilitates the use of the forward
slash directly in the AQL file. If you use the regular expression
in other tools, remove the escape character on the forward slash to
properly capture your input examples.</div>
