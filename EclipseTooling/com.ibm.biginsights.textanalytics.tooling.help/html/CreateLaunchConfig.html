					<dt class="dt dlterm">How the Text Analytics system stores
						extraction results in the file system</dt>
					<dd class="dd">
						<p class="p">
							After an extractor runs, one result file is generated for each
							input document. All result files have the <span
								class="ph filepath">.strf</span> file extension. Result files
							are stored in the file system so that results can be displayed in
							the Text Analytics tool.
						</p>
						<p class="p">
							Input files that do not have annotations are not serialized and
							not considered for processing in the <span class="keyword">InfoSphere
								BigInsights Tools for Eclipse</span>.
						</p>
						<p class="p">
							If the input document is a file with no special characters within
							a directory, then the name of the result file (<span
								class="ph filepath">.strf</span>) is the same as the input file.
							However, for some data collections (such as a <span
								class="ph filepath">.ZIP</span> file, a directory with a
							subdirectory, or a <span class="ph filepath">del</span> file with
							internal labels that contain special characters), the name of the
							result file cannot be directly mapped to the input file name.
							This occurs because the label can contain certain special
							characters that are not allowed in a file name (such as
							<var class="keyword varname"> '/',
								'?','%','*',':','|','&lt;','&gt;','\','"'</var>
							). As a result, the Text Analytics system flattens the hierarchy
							(in the case of a <span class="ph filepath">.zip</span> directory
							or a subdirectory), or it normalizes the file name with special
							characters (in the case of <span class="ph filepath">del</span>
							files that contain input document labels as URLs, for example, by
							replacing the path separators and special characters with a
							special character <span class="keyword parmname parmname">'~'</span>).
							In rare situations, two input documents can have labels with the
							same result file name, differentiated by a version number, for
							example <span class="ph filepath">MyDoc.strf</span> and <span
								class="ph filepath">MyDoc(1).strf</span>. Results are also saved
							in a <span class="ph filepath">result-&lt;system-timestamp&gt;</span>
							subdirectory in the <span class="ph filepath">result</span>
							directory for the project. See <a class="xref"
								href="compare_results/comparing_results_of_one_extractor_run_to_another.html"
								title="Comparing the results of one extractor run to the results of another run can be useful when you are testing an extractor. Each time a launch configuration is run, a new subdirectory named result-system-timestamp is saved in the result directory of the project.">Comparing
								the results of one extractor run to the results of another run</a>
							to compare the performance of the results. See <a class="xref"
								href="compare_results/eval_qual_extract_by_comb_evdata_set_with_ann_diff_viewer.html"
