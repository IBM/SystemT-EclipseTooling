NB: this plugin must be unpacked on installation.  To achieve this, the (almost non-existent) code
of the plugin is packaged into a jar (see build.properties).  This is the only way I know of to
reliably get Eclipse to package the plugin so it gets unpacked on installation.

The reason the plugin must be in a directory, not a jar, is LanguageWare, as usual.
