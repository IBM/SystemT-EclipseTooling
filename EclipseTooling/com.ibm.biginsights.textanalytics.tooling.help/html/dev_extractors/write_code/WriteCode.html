(AQL). </p>
<div class="section context"><div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">About this task</h2></div><p class="p">AQL is a declarative and expressive language that offers a comprehensive set of built-in extraction primitives. These extraction primitives range from feature extraction primitives such as regular expressions, dictionaries and part-of-speech to set-level primitives such as union, join, and aggregation for manipulating and combining these features. </p>
<p class="p">The top-level components of an AQL
extractor are its <dfn class="term">views</dfn>, logical statements that define
but do not necessarily compute a set of tuples. An <dfn class="term">extractor</dfn> consists
of a collection of views, each of which defines a relation. Some of
these views are designated as <samp class="ph codeph">output views</samp>, while
others are <samp class="ph codeph">non-output views</samp>. An extractor is sometimes
referred to as annotator. It is an information extraction program
that extracts structured information from unstructured or semistructured
text by using AQL constructs.</p>
<p class="p">Even though AQL is a powerful language, you might want to perform operations on extracted values that are not supported by AQL. For example, you want to normalize a value by converting it to lowercase and removing multiple consecutive white spaces or make a web-service call to validate an extracted credit card number. To enable this, AQL provides custom defined functions to be used in extraction rules, called user-defined functions (UDFs). UDF JAR files are JAR files that contain these UDF classes. </p>
