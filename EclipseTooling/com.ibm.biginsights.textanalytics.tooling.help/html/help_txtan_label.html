					a document that is in the list in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Step
						1 : Select Documents</span> wizard, and click <span class="ph uicontrol">Open</span>.
					The document opens in the AQL Editor pane. By reading the document,
					or searching for particular phrases, you create your list of
					examples and clues.
			</span></li>
			<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Find
					a phrase that is meaningful to the goal and that offers an example
					of either a positive or negative result. For example, if your goal
					is to learn more about the financial growth of a company, you might
					search for the term <dfn class="term">revenue</dfn>. When you find
					that term, highlight the term, right-click it, and click <span
					class="ph uicontrol">Add Example with New label</span>.
			</span>
				<p class="p">
					The root label and all sublabels contain four groups. These groups
					are based on the main steps in building extractors (basic features,
					candidate generation, and filter and consolidate) and the special
					group <span class="keyword parmname parmname">finals</span>, which
					contains final output and export views, tables, and dictionaries.
					You are encouraged to use this grouping to develop extractors.
				</p>
				<div class="p">
					Each group of a root label is linked with a module that is created
					together with the root label. The first time that you create a root
					label (also called a top-level label), four modules are created
					automatically:
					<ul class="ul">
						<li class="li">&lt;root_label_name&gt;_BasicFeatures</li>
						<li class="li">&lt;root_label_name&gt;_CandidateGeneration</li>
						<li class="li">&lt;root_label_name&gt;_FilterConsolidate</li>
						<li class="li">&lt;root_label_name&gt;_Finals</li>
					</ul>
					You can see these default modules by opening the Package Explorer
					and browsing to the <span class="ph filepath">&lt;project_name&gt;\textAnalytics\src\</span>
					directory. You can create your own modules, but it is recommended
					that you use these default modules to create your AQL scripts.
