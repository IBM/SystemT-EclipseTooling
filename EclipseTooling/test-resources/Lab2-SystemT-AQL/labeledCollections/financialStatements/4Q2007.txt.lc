IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced fourth-quarter 2007 diluted earnings of $2.80 per share from continuing operations compared with diluted earnings of $2.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 24 percent as reported.

&quot;IBM had a terrific fourth quarter and full year with record revenue, profit and cash. The broad scope of our global business --- led by strong operational performance in Asia, Europe and emerging countries --- as well as continued growth in services and software drove these outstanding results,&quot; said Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. &quot;As we begin 2008, IBM is well-positioned as a result of our global business reach, solid recurring revenue and profit streams, and strong financial position. We are on track to achieve our long-term earnings-per-share roadmap objective in 2010.&quot; &#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
IBM ended 2007 with $16.1 billion of cash on hand and free cash flow of $12.4 billion, up 1.9 billion year over year. The balance sheet remains strong, and the company is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. &#xD;
&#xD;
Share repurchases totaled approximately $18.8 billion in 2007, including $12.5 billion executed through accelerated share repurchase agreements in May. The repurchases are part of the $15 billion authorization for the company's stock repurchase program approved by the IBM board of directors on April 24. &#xD;
&#xD;
The weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding in 2007 was 1.45 billion compared with 1.55 billion shares in 2006. As of December 31, 2007, there were 1.39 billion basic common shares outstanding. &#xD;
&#xD;
Debt, including Global Financing, totaled $35.3 billion, compared with $22.7 billion at year-end 2006. From a management segment view, Global Financing debt increased $2.2 billion from year-end 2006 to a total of $24.5 billion, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 7.1 to 1. The non- global financing debt-to-capitalization ratio was 30.0 percent at the end of 2007, which reflects increased financial leverage associated with the accelerated share repurchase agreements. &#xD;
